        "(a) Proof:\n",
        "Let X be the event that the minhash value is \"don't know\" for a column with m 1's and n-m 0's.\n",
        "When we randomly choose k rows out of n, the probability that a particular 1 appears in none of the chosen rows is (1-k/n)^k. Since there are m 1's, the probability that all m 1's appear in none of the k rows is (1-k/n)^(km). Thus, P(X) is the probability that none of the m 1's appear in the k chosen rows, which is (1-k/n)^(km).\n",
        "Using the inequality (1-x)^y <= e^(-xy) for x in [0,1] and y >= 0, we have:\n",
        "P(X) = (1-k/n)^(km) <= e^(-km/n)\n",
        "Now, we want to find an upper bound on P(X). Since n is much larger than m or k, we can use the approximation:\n",
        "(1-x) ~ e^(-x) for small x\n",
        "So, we get:\n",

        "(b) Solution:\n",
        "We want P(X) <= e^(-10), i.e.,\n",

        "-km/n <= -10\n",
        "k/n >= 10m/n\n",
        "k >= 10m\n",
        "So, the smallest value of k that will ensure P(X) <= e^(-10) is k = 10m.\n",
